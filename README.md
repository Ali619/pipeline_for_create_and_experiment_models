# A pipeline to train and compare 2 Torchvision models

In this pipeline, I choosed *EfficientNet_B0* and *EfficientNet_B2* to train them with 2 datasets and different amounts of epochs to see what is the best combination to get the most accuracy for my task which is a food classification. 

The instracture of using this pipline is in the `main_(notebook_version).ipynb` file. If you have any suggestion to upgrade this pipeline, feel free to open a **pull request** or let me know in the *discussions page*
